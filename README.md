# FiveSPN-Clock

FiveSPN-Clock is a FiveM server resource that will sync all players game time to a real world time, or a scaled time. Want the server to be evening everyday at noon? Want longer day night cycles? This is your answer! 

## Installation

Copy the folder inside of the FiveMResource folder into your server's resources folder and add it to the server configuration file.

### In server config
```
ensure FiveSPN-Clock
```

A complete server use package with all FiveSPN resources is available [here](https://github.com/SourPatchNom/FiveSPN---Suite)

## Settings

You can update the settings in the fxmanifest.
```lua
utc_offset '0' -- The offset in hours from UTC time for the server - Always positive number less than 24 or 0
time_scale '0' -- The speed scale of time from real world time. (IE '2' Means two days for every one real day.) - Always greater than one. 
```

## Commands

All players:
```lua
VerifyTime - Will force an update to the client time.
```
Players in group ServerAdmin or ClockAdmin:
```lua
SetTimeOffset # - Will set the time offset from within the game.
SetTimeScale # - Will set the time scale from within the game.
```
